Working with the DOM 
DOM = Document Object Model
(aka: how you use JavaScript to modify a website)

Document = HTML document

Object = {HTML document} object is JavaScript key word for data type. Meaning we've taken the html document and classed it as JavaScript object.

Document object = <h2 id="count-el">0</h2>
Model = let countEl = document.getElementById("count-el"); 

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

Working with the DOM 
DOM = Document Object Model
(aka: How you use JavaScript to modify a website)

Document = HTML document

Object = {HTML document} object is JavaScript key word for data type. Meaning we've taken the html document and classed it as JavaScript object.

Document object = <h2 id="count-el">0</h2>
Model = let countEl = document.getElementById("count-el"); 

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

// Challenge: 
let username = "per"
let message = "You have tree new notifications"

console.log(message + ", " + username + "!")

// Create a variable, messageToUser, that contains the message we have logged
 
 let messageToUser = message + ", " + username + "!"
 console.log(messageToUser) // Correct solution 

Challenge:
// Create two variables, name and greeting. The name variable should store your name,
// and the greeting should store e.g. "Hi, my name is "

// Create a third variable, myGreeting, that contatenates the two strings
// Log myGreeting to the console

let name = "Jake"
let greeting = "Hi, my name is "
let myGreeting = name + greeting 
console log
